Inspired from our previous post about [how to secure a GWT app using Spring Security](http://www.g-widgets.com/2016/12/09/securing-a-gwt-app-using-spring-security/), we thought it would more simple for users to have the setup as an archetype, so we have created a new archetype which is now part of the [gwt-ui-archetypes project](https://github.com/gwidgets/gwt-ui-archetypes). The archetype is a multi module maven project with a client module, which contains the GWT app, and a server module that contains the security configuration. Hoping that it will come handy!
