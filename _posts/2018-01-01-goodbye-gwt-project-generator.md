After watching the community feel for the project for a while, we have decided to shutdown the project. The objective of the project was to provide help with the initial bootstrap of a GWT app, based on the concept of  [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) . It seems like a new GWT project is not created that often, if compared to Spring boot which is used for microservices, and thus the need for a bootstrap helper is more compelling. gwt-project-generator did receive some good feedback from the GWT community initially, but on the long run the interest seems to decrease, and this is the reason we have decided to discontinue it. The project is still on GitHub: <https://github.com/gwidgets/gwt-project-generator>, but not maintained anymore.
