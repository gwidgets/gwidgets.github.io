We would like to share some 2017 data:

  First of all, we would like to thank the followers of this blog for their input and feedback. We have been doing our efforts to provide quality tutorials / tips about GWT mainly. We hope all of this is handy. We know there have not been so many, and the main reason is that there were some periods where we were undertaking client projects full time and nobody from the team was available to write . The quality of posts remains our focus. The number of views can also give insight to the community and people wondering about the future of GWT. Based on the analytics data, There is a constant and regular number of readers interested in GWT, so GWT is definitely still used. Compared to other frameworks, GWT can be seen as niche market used by web applications with special requirements like the need for sharing code between the client and the server, and the need for object orientation, strong typing that can cannot be offered right away by a native javascript app. The stagnant release cycle makes us wonder thought.

  For the 2018, we are exploring other technologies/frameworks like Scala.js and Kotlin to JavaScript. The rise of reactive programming make us also want to include topics about it. We are planning to diversify this blog to include those topics.<br /> The post about <a href="http://www.g-widgets.com/2017/06/26/overview-of-scala-js-from-an-gwt-developer-perspective/">Scala.js</a> was the one that got the highest number of views, so we are looking into writing more about this topic since Scala is also a JVM language. This would allows us to draw parallels between GWT and Scala.js. Kotlin looks like a promising JVM language, and the support for the to JavaScript seems is an attractive subject that would like to explore as well. With all that being said, we would like to say thank you to all our awesome readers.
